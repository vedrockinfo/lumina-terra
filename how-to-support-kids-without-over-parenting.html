                        <p>Sometimes, in trying to shield children from every bump, we weaken their ability to be independent. With the best intentions, over-parenting can turn childhood into a project we manage, rather than a stage for growth.</p>
                        <p>Supportive parenting does not mean we do everything for them. It means being available but letting them learn by doing it by themselves. Independence begins with small choices. A simple “I trust you” carries more weight than a thousand instructions. These moments build confidence and resilience. These are often more valuable than test scores.</p>
                        <p>Picking which clothes to wear, packing their own bag, or settling a quarrel with a friend on their own. These can build thinking skills more than constant correction without knowing the reason why. Accepting mistakes is integral to developing independence. Mistakes are part of the learning every child must get. When a child forgets homework or struggles with a project, our instinct is to step in, but that’s exactly what we must resist in our own behaviour. Letting them face the consequence of forgetting, or push through a challenge, teaches problem-solving and ownership.</p>
                        <p>Parenting, at its core, is about raising capable, confident young people who know right from wrong, who can care for themselves and others, and take care of their environment. If we want them to grow into independent adults, we need to step back a little, and we need to resist the urge to overindulge.</p>
