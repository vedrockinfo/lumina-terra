                        <p>Look at most classrooms, even the so-called progressive ones, and you will still find the
                            same old rhythm: fixed timetables, 45-minute periods, a curriculum that keeps moving whether
                            children are ready or not. Structure is everywhere. But often, it is the kind that cages
                            learning instead of supporting it.</p>
                        <p>Too much rigidity can smother what learning needs the most, that is, space. Space to ask, to
                            try, to fail, to try again. Real learning doesn&apos;t follow a script. And yet, we keep
                            trying to script it.</p>
                        <p>That&apos;s where PATH comes in. In classrooms using the ALfA approach, the structure bends.
                            Children work in pairs. They move forward when they understand not when the bell rings. Some
                            cover three concepts in a day. Others stay with one until it clicks. That flexibility is not
                            a flaw. It&apos;s the whole point.</p>
                        <p>There are fourteen years of schooling, if we consider three years of pre-school. That is a
                            long time. We repeat what children already know. We waste more time than we utilize it for
                            effective gain in learning. Year on year learning is very low, as per John Hattie&apos;s
                            meta-analysis.</p>
                        <p>Teachers don&apos;t push the whole class ahead in one sweep. Children move themselves,
                            regardless of any system. Why not have a partner beside them. Let the teacher step in only
                            when needed, not to rush, but to guide. Set clear goals, peer assessments, and visible
                            progress, but they need to be all child-driven.</p>
                        <p>This way of working sometimes called the “no script” model can look unfamiliar. Classrooms
                            are often active, noisy, full of movement. Older supervisory staff who expect silence, rows,
                            and teacher control sometimes see this as chaotic, sometimes noisy. But it is more
                            productive than quiet stillness. What they are seeing is not disorder. It is learning, in
                            real time.</p>
                        <p>And the results are hard to ignore. PATH classrooms have jumped multiple grade levels in a
                            matter of weeks. Not because they are being forced forward, but because they are finally
                            free to move when ready.</p>
                        <p>The fear that flexibility means a lack of control is outdated. Children don&apos;t need to be
                            tightly managed to make progress. They need to be trusted, supported, and given the room to
                            take charge of their own learning. PATH, based on the proven ALfA pedagogy that is
                            accelerating learning for all, proves that when classrooms are built to respond to the
                            child, not restrict them, they don&apos;t fall behind. They leap ahead.</p>
                        <p>The question is not whether children can lead their own learning. The question is why are we
                            still afraid to let them?</p>
