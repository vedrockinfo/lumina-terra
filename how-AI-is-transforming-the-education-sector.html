                        <p>AI is no longer the future. It is already shaping the present of education in profound ways. But the real question is not whether we adopt AI. If AI becomes another tool to reinforce rote learning, and top-down instruction, we will have missed the opportunity entirely.</p>
                        <p>When used thoughtfully, AI can do more than just automate tasks. It can save teachers time, personalize each child’s learning journey, and offer real-time feedback that helps learners grow. It can improve vocabulary, and add to the imagination. These shift the focus from learning content to developing thinking, creativity, and deeper understanding using AI as a tool.</p>
                        <p>But here is the catch. No matter how advanced AI becomes, it cannot replace the warmth of a human voice: the ability to sense a child’s confusion, or the wisdom to handle moral questions, show empathy and emotional connection. Human interaction will always be required.</p>
                        <p>That is why PATH (Purposeful, Active, Transformative, and Holistic) and ALfA (Accelerating Learning for All) take a different route. Instead of plugging technology into old methods, they flip the script.</p>
                        <p>Instead of sitting passively glued to screens, they learn together, in pairs, and create that social-emotional bond with each other. They collaborate. They ask questions. Solve problems. Teach one another. They use AI to build understanding, to ride it, not to be ridden by it.</p>
