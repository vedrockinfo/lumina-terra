                                    (FLM)</a> is an overarching approach and framework for learning and teaching,
                                encompassing nine key elements. These elements describe the type of learning that we
                                value and develop throughout all our school stages and programmes.</p>
                            <p>The review of our Intelligent Classroom model led to the creation of the Lumina Terra
                                Future Learning Model (FLM), stemming from the online learning and teaching experiences
                                during the months of lockdown, when a distance educational model was implemented and new
                                methodological formats, tools and ways of learning were adopted. The FLM takes into
                                account the impact of this experience on the future and redefines the purpose of the
                                school as a “place” to develop a much broader concept of learning that serves the needs
                                of our Educational Community. To further explore these and other aspects of our approach
                                to education, Lumina Terra set up a Think-Action Tank.</p>
