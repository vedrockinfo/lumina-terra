                        <p>We all talk about moving beyond rote. But in most classrooms, not much has changed. Textbooks
                            still dictate the day. Teachers still do most of the talking. Exams still reward recall, not
                            understanding.</p>
                        <p>Here’s what actually works for schools to break that pattern.</p>
                        <p>First, get students to talk more than teachers. It’s not a slogan, it’s a proven practice.
                            Put them in random, mixed-ability pairs. Let them explain concepts to each other. You’ll see
                            it immediately, children who struggled to pay attention suddenly lean in. The language feels
                            their own. They learn by listening, speaking, and questioning. It’s noisy, but it works.</p>
                        <p>Second, treat the textbook as a reference, not the curriculum itself. Real learning isn’t
                            about covering chapters, it’s about uncovering understanding. Maths through manipulatives,
                            language through stories, science through experiments. Move from known to unknown – instead
                            of ‘a for apple’, we need ‘apple : a’. Every concept should pass the “can they explain it to
                            their pair” test.</p>
                        <p>Third, set a clear daily learning goal. Help students track progress themselves – put them in
                            charge of their own learning. It builds agency, shows growth, and makes learning visible.
                        </p>
                        <p>These strategies are core to the ALfA (Accelerating Learning for All) pedagogy, now being
                            used in thousands of schools across India, with powerful results: children learning to read,
                            write, and do basic maths swiftly. And going beyond, developing their 21st century skills of
                            collaboration and critical thinking.</p>
                        <p>This is the revolution all schools need. It’s real. And it works.</p>
