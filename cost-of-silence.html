                            <p><em>“Pin Drop Silence!” Many of us recall our teachers bellowing at us.</em></p>
                        <p>Discipline in classrooms is often associated with silence. A quiet child is often considered to be obedient and is clearly seen as attentive and well-behaved. However, what is often referred to as “good behaviour” has its downsides too. Children who become silent, no longer question things. And when questioning becomes silent, the only thing left in the name of “learning” is either rote memorization or mechanical compliance to pass the standards set by the instructor.</p>
                        <p>Silence is not neutral. It instructs children that their voices hold less weight when compared to the teacher. It requires them to suppress their curiosity. It warns them that speaking up is fraught with danger. The impact of this phenomenon is not limited to the classroom, it fundamentally alters their engagement and interaction with the outside world.</p>
                        <p>When children are instructed not to speak, either through overt guidelines or through implicit classroom norms, their growth of identity, critical thinking, and confidence are all severely compromised.</p>
                        <p>Being listened to reinforces a child's confident persona. They articulate their questions, curiosities, and even mistakes to forge a sense of identity. Without the opportunity to speak, a child will not be able to explore, clarify, or articulate their own thoughts. The outcome of this is often learned passivity, a conditioned state of inertia awaiting a command instead of actively engaging with the world.</p>
                        <p>Questioning is the foundation of critical thinking. It flourishes when children are given the freedom to inquire, challenge, and even explore other perspectives. Unfortunately, in most classrooms, the urge to remain quiet and “stay on track” takes priority over free expression. The focus becomes covering the syllabus instead of deepening comprehension.</p>
                        <p>The more profound impact is when quiet children begin to unlearn the concept of personal identity. And when children are repeatedly taught to suppress their voices, they are taught to disregard their lived realities, cultures and identities. These children of quiet classrooms tend to struggle to reclaim their voices with age, speech becomes scarce in boardrooms, community gatherings and even at home.</p>
                        <p>To prepare children for life beyond school. We need classrooms that centre their views, not silence them. Their voice matters. It is not chaos. It is dialogue. It requires redefining the teacher's role, not as a primary talker, but as someone who encourages dialogue as a strategy for improving learning. It requires open questions, developing the skills by which children are not only responders but also questioners.</p>
                        <p>By working with the children, the first thing I noticed was how they begin to flourish when given a chance to talk. Their thinking becomes more elaborate. Their explanations enable rapid learning. This continues to amaze me, and also baffle me. If children can learn better through dialogue, why don’t we use it more often? In fact, why not use it as an integral process in our transaction of learning? It is not a small shift. It is a small cultural shift that transforms school life.</p>
                        <p>The consequences of silence are staggering. To cultivate independent thinkers who evolve into globally minded citizens, we need to help children not only be heard, but also hear each other. Their voices must always be celebrated, not silenced.</p>
