                        <p>We often celebrate the top scorers, the high achieving students who follow instructions, meet
                            deadlines, and master exams. They are disciplined, dependable, and easy to teach.</p>
                        <p>But here’s the paradox: these very students are often the hardest to reach when it comes to
                            deeper learning.
                            What I have observed again and again is this: the more success a student has in the
                            traditional system, the more they tend to trust it. They learn early on that there is one
                            right answer, one correct method, one way to win. And so, they become excellent at following
                            rules but hesitant to question them.</p>
                        <p>This creates a problem when we try to introduce a new way of thinking. Whether it is open
                            ended inquiry, peer discussion, or creative problem-solving, the students who have always
                            excelled in rigid, structured environments are often the most resistant. Not because they
                            lack ability, but because they have so much invested in the old way of doing things.</p>
                        <p>They have been trained to perform, not to think beyond the frame. They ask, “What’s the
                            correct answer?” instead of “What else could be true?” They look for the shortest path to
                            approval, not the richest path to understanding.</p>
                        <p>In many classrooms I have worked with, it is the so-called average or struggling students who
                            adapt more easily to new pedagogies. They have less to unlearn. They are not as bound to the
                            old rules. When given space to think, reflect, and collaborate, they often surprise
                            everyone, including themselves.</p>
                        <p>One approach reshaping this dynamic is ALfA-Accelerating Learning for All. ALfA flips the
                            traditional model by placing children at the centre of the learning process through
                            structured peer learning. In ALfA classrooms, children teach and learn from each other in
                            pairs. This is not just a technique it is a shift in mindset. Children don’t wait to be
                            told, they explore, explain, and discover together.</p>
                        <p>The results are remarkable. Children become more collaborative, creative, and confident. They
                            don’t just recall information, they make sense of it, apply it, and communicate it. This
                            model levels the playing field. Those who struggled in traditional classrooms often thrive
                            here. Freed from the rigid top-down model, they engage more fully and progress faster.</p>
                        <p>This should challenge how we define academic success. A child who scores well but struggles
                            with ambiguity, creativity, or dialogue is not fully prepared for the world outside school.
                            The future will not reward those who simply remember well. It will reward those who can
                            adapt, rethink, and respond.</p>
                        <p>And in today’s world, that is more urgent than ever. We now live alongside machines that can
                            retrieve, summarise, and compute faster than any human. AI is doing what machines are built
                            to do, process vast information, automate tasks, deliver answers in seconds. That is no
                            longer the job of the student.</p>
                        <p>What children must learn now is how to use these tools wisely. They must know when to rely on
                            machines, and when to go beyond them. We don’t need human versions of search engines. We
                            need thinkers, questioners, ethical users of powerful tools.</p>
                        <p>Unlearning is not about discarding knowledge. It is about loosening our grip on rigid ways of
                            thinking. And this is where our education system must evolve, by designing experiences that
                            challenge even our top performers to let go of perfection and embrace possibility.</p>
                        <p>The goal of education is not to produce well-behaved machines. It is to shape responsive,
                            resilient minds. And sometimes, that begins by asking even our brightest students to start
                            over with curiosity, not certainty.</p>
