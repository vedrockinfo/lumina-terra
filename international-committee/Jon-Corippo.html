                                <p>Eduprotocols co-creator Jon Corippo describes himself as a “formerly disgruntled student.” He made it almost all the way through school with a 2.9 GPA. Jon graduated from college with no intention of teaching. After rising to a county-level Assistant Superintendent role, followed by running one of the largest educational non-profits in CA, Jon spent 2020-21 teaching 6th grade “human children'' in Madera County in Central California. Eduprotocols went from being Jon’s hobby to becoming his full-time work in 2022. Jon presents worldwide, helping teachers to “Teach Better Work Less”. Jon has been recognized as a County Teacher of the Year, a 20 to Watch Educator by the NSBA, and named a Top 100 Influencer by EdTech Digest. The Eduprotocols book series has sold nearly 70,000 copies worldwide, and Jon has done over 850 live classroom demos in 6 states and five countries since 2021.</p>
