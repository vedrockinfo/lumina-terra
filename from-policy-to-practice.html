                        <p>Since independence, India has crafted four national education policies, in 1968, 1986, a
                            revision in 1992, and the latest New Education Policy 2020 (NEP 2020).</p>
                        <p>These policies have evolved with time from ensuring access and literacy, to focus on equity
                            and inclusion, to quality of education, decentralized planning and teacher training.</p>
                        <p>The first policy in 1968 emphasized basic literacy. In 1986, spotlight shifted to quality
                            education with such programs as Sarv Shiksha Abhiyan. It was not until 34 years later that
                            NEP 2020 pointed out there were 5 crore children in primary schools who lacked foundational
                            literacy and numeracy (FLN) skills. It was an urgent call to action.</p>
                        <p>Within one year, in July 2021, the NIPUN Bharat Mission with a deadline of 2026/27 was set up
                            to help State and UT governments put the highest priority of education on FLN. Yet, as we
                            near the final year of the mission, the picture is nowhere near as rosy as hoped.</p>
                        <p>There are lessons in this for all aspects of education reform, and what must be done
                            differently to achieve goals.</p>
                        <p>Reforms have often been layered on top of existing systems. The NCERT / SCERT books have not,
                            by and large, changed their content or shifted their focus to FLN. The timetable, the
                            syllabus with multiple subjects and the full curriculum and the systems they operate in have
                            remained largely intact; while real reform would have required making space for FLN.</p>
                        <p>This reveals a core aspect of policy reform in education.</p>
                        <p>Some states did respond with bridge courses, campaigns, supplementary materials, and
                            training, stricter supervision of FLN goals, but these efforts were generally short-term,
                            and not systemic. They were layered on the regular school schedules. Teachers have been
                            asked to juggle between more goals.</p>
                        <p>Systems have often dictated which pages to teach in which week, and how to teach and assess.
                            This stifles initiative and keeps past agendas intact.</p>
                        <p>If we are to rethink education reform, teachers will need more autonomy, time and trust.
                            Instead of holding them accountable for page counts, let them teach for impact; hold them
                            accountable for outcomes.</p>
                        <p>Progressive policies like NEP 2020 speak of joyful learning, collaboration, critical thinking
                            and flexibility, yet, teaching is still driven by rigid curricula. Unless we define success
                            differently, reforms will remain on paper, and become tick box exercises.</p>
                        <p>FLN is not one goal among many. We agree it is the gateway to all others. But the system
                            treats it as an add-on. Textbooks remain unchanged, the school timetable still puts priority
                            on syllabus coverage, and there’s a lot more added on a teacher’s plate, with nothing taken
                            out. Meanwhile children are slipping behind, despite major focus, effort, and expenditure.
                        </p>
                        <p>To shift focus from policy to practice, we may need to more effectively engage the private
                            sector, especially those institutions involved in cutting-edge research on education, and
                            look at recent evidence on what is working.</p>
                        <p>Accelerating Learning for All is a disruptive way to educate children which starts with
                            swift, effective teaching of FLN skills in an average of 45 days, then plugs into existing
                            textbooks, to ensure newly acquired skills help children cover the textbook content more
                            effectively, and time efficiently, leading to a quality education for all.</p>
                        <p>To ensure education is impactful and real, we need to be a little more circumspect of
                            existing ‘best’ practices, even as results from them after years have not shown much
                            traction.</p>
                        <p>We need to open up to new ways of conducting education. We need to allow new practices and
                            pedagogies to surface.
                            Many NGOs have been researching new and more impactful ways to educate. They need to be
                            welcomed to showcase their results without overlapping mandates with other NGOs in the same
                            geographies. A comparative analysis based on evidence needs to be conducted by DIETs and
                            third parties to objectively evaluate the impact of the various approaches.</p>
                        <p>Policymakers need to support those practices that show results on the ground, then scale
                            those ideas that show promise, then fully integrate them within systems for permanent
                            change, to reap its benefits into the future, rather than keep filling gaps created by an
                            inadequate education.</p>
                        <p>We must prioritize FLN through integration of FLN goals in the existing textbooks, or through
                            a supplement, and create space for it until all children are literate and numerate. This
                            will be the surest path to a quality education.
                            It is time that we rethink about reform.</p>
