                        <p>Walk into many schools today and you&apos;ll see smartboards, colorful furniture, maybe even
                            project-based units. The factory model, we&apos;re told, is behind us.</p>
                        <p>But look again. The structure hasn&apos;t really changed. Teachers still do most of the
                            talking. Students still spend most of their time listening, waiting, absorbing. Knowledge
                            still flows one way from the front of the room to the back. We&apos;ve dressed up the
                            classroom, but the script is still the same.</p>
                        <p>Progressive methods are everywhere in theory: flipped classrooms, active learning, edtech.
                            But in practice, many classrooms are stuck in a loop, trying to innovate without letting go
                            of control.</p>
                        <p>We&apos;ve traded chalkboards for tablets, but not authority for agency. We&apos;re measuring
                            everything—attendance, homework, quiz scores but ignoring what matters most: is the child
                            actually learning?</p>
                        <p>Too often, the answer is no.</p>
                        <h4 class="heading-tertiary">The Real Problem: Transactional Teaching</h4>
                        <p>Here&apos;s what&apos;s really going on: our classrooms are built on transactions. A teacher
                            “delivers” a lesson. Students “receive” it. There&apos;s a test, some marks, maybe a
                            project. But the deeper work of learning—making meaning, applying ideas, building
                            confidence—often never starts. Even well-trained, well-meaning teachers are stuck in systems
                            that reward delivery over discovery. So, kids sit quietly, nodding, copying, memorizing. And
                            learning gaps quietly widen. This isn&apos;t about lazy teaching. It&apos;s about a system
                            that&apos;s still too top-heavy, even when it pretends not to be.</p>
                        <p>Now imagine this instead: Two children, face to face. One explains a concept. The other
                            listens, asks, tries it out. Then they switch. They check each other&apos;s work. They
                            explain again, differently this time. They start to get it.</p>
                        <p>That&apos;s peer-led, paired learning. That&apos;s what the ALfA model is built around. And
                            here&apos;s the thing: it&apos;s not a supplement. It&apos;s a replacement for the old
                            model.</p>
                        <p>In ALfA classrooms, children don&apos;t wait to be taught. They teach. They learn by doing,
                            explaining, correcting, supporting. They move faster because they&apos;re driving the
                            learning themselves—not waiting for it to arrive.</p>
                        <p>In hundreds of ALfA classrooms, kids who were years behind have caught up in weeks—not
                            through tech or tutoring, but through structured peer learning. In a Harvard-led study, ALfA
                            students showed an effect size of 0.89 in just over a month. That&apos;s enormous.
                            Especially in under-resourced settings.</p>
                        <p>This isn&apos;t just effective. It&apos;s efficient. And it's human.</p>
                        <p>Why It Works ? When a child explains something to another, they simplify, repeat, reframe.
                            They build empathy. They make space for questions. And both children benefit—because
                            explaining is learning too.</p>
                        <p>Paired learning builds confidence, curiosity, and communication not as extras, but as
                            essentials. It unlocks the very things the traditional classroom suppresses.</p>
                        <p>And the Teacher? They don&apos;t disappear. They evolve from controller to designer. From the
                            centre to the edge, where they can see the whole system working. They observe, nudge,
                            support. They create the space for children to own the process.</p>
                        <p>But Is It Realistic? Yes. ALfA started in 20 schools. It&apos;s now in 35,000. The model is
                            practical and scalable. And most importantly, it trusts children. That may be the biggest
                            shift of all.</p>
                        <p>What&apos;s in the Way? Mostly, fear. Fear of losing control. Fear of being seen as “doing
                            less.” Fear of letting children lead. But also, inertia—old habits dressed up in new
                            language.</p>
                        <p>We&apos;ve accepted the idea that learning takes years, that progress must be slow, that gaps
                            are inevitable. But that&apos;s not based on evidence. It&apos;s just tradition.</p>
                        <p>The truth is: when learning is shared, it speeds up. When it&apos;s owned, it sticks. And
                            when it&apos;s joyful, it scales.</p>
                        <h4 class="heading-tertiary">In the Age of AI, What Really Matters?</h4>
                        <p>Now that machines can write, solve, and even teach what do humans bring to the table?</p>
                        <p><strong>Collaboration. Empathy. Leadership. Creativity. Agency.</strong></p>
                        <p>All of which happen naturally when children learn together, not alone.</p>
                        <p>So, What Now? We don&apos;t need more pilot projects. We need to change the core of how we
                            see learning. ALfA has shown it&apos;s possible in schools across economic divides, across
                            geographies. Not in theory. In action.</p>
                        <p>So, let&apos;s stop waiting for another tool or another training. Let&apos;s trust
                            what&apos;s already in the room: the children. Let them learn. Let them lead. Let learning
                            become something shared, not performed.</p>
                        <p>Because one-way teaching is still holding us back.</p>
